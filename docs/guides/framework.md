**Architectural Overview**

A narrative explaining how the system components (frontend, backend, database, task server) collaborate to deliver the feature.

**Sequence Diagram**

A Mermaid.js diagram illustrating the end-to-end flow, from user action to final output. This is a critical, code-free way to visualize the process.

**Key Component Pointers**

A curated list of references to the most important parts of the codebase. This is a "map" to the code, not a copy of it.

*Example: Data Models: `Highlight`, `HighlightedUtterance` in `prisma/schema.prisma`.*

**Business Rules & Assumptions**

A list of important constraints or logic that isn't explicit in the code structure (e.g., "Highlights can only be created for meetings with a complete transcript").
