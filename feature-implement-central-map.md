### Concept
Implement a central map that lists subjects discussed in city council across all supported municipalities.

### User Story
As a citizen, I want to explore council subjects on a map so that I can easily discover what is being discussed in my own and nearby municipalities.

### Functional Requirements

The map should have different layers/modes:

- **Subjects Mode**: 
  - Shows locations of subjects discussed in city councils.
  - Date range picker (e.g., defaulting to the last 6 months).
  - Category picker.
  - Municipality picker.
  - A toggle to only show subjects that were discussed for at least 5 minutes.

- **Municipalities Mode**: 
  - Displays supported municipalities with a distinct visual style (e.g., orange polygons).
  - Shows unsupported municipalities with a different style (e.g., shades of blue) indicating the number of petitions they have.
