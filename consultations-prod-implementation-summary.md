### Detailed Breakdown Based on PRD Requirements

#### 1. Core Feature: A Dual-View Consultation Platform

The changes successfully build the two primary interfaces outlined in the PRD for interacting with a regulation.

*   **Document View (`ConsultationDocument.tsx`):**
    *   A structured, hierarchical view of the regulation's chapters and articles has been implemented.
    *   **Expandable Sections**: Chapters and articles are rendered as collapsible sections, allowing users to get a clear overview and dive into details as needed, directly fulfilling the PRD's requirement.
    *   **AI Summaries**: `AISummaryCard.tsx` was created to display AI-generated summaries for chapters and articles, enhancing readability.
    *   **Navigation**: A `DocumentNavigation` component provides a "you are here" style sidebar on larger screens, improving user orientation within the complex document.

*   **Interactive Map View (`ConsultationMap.tsx`):**
    *   A full-screen, interactive map is now the central component of the map view.
    *   **Layer Controls**: A mobile-friendly `LayerControlsPanel` allows users to toggle the visibility of different geographic data sets (`geosets`) and individual locations, meeting the "Interactive Layer Control" requirement precisely.
    *   **Detail Panel**: A `DetailPanel` slides in to display detailed information when a user clicks on a geographic feature, fulfilling a key PRD requirement for a seamless experience.
    *   **Derived Geometries**: The system was enhanced to support "derived geometries." For example, it can now automatically calculate and display a 300-meter buffer zone around designated parking spots, reducing manual data entry and ensuring accuracy.

*   **View Toggling (`ViewToggleButton.tsx`):**
    *   A floating action button was implemented, allowing users to seamlessly switch between the Document and Map views, exactly as specified in the PRD.

#### 2. Data and Content: The Athens E-Scooter Regulation

The PRD's goal of using the Athens e-scooter regulation as the primary example has been fully realized.

*   **Massive Data Expansion (`public/regulation.json`):**
    *   The `regulation.json` file was populated with the complete and detailed Athens e-scooter regulation. This includes hundreds of specific geographic locations, such as **no-go zones, slow-speed streets, designated parking spots, and high-speed roads**.
    *   This provides a rich, real-world dataset that demonstrates the platform's full capabilities.
*   **Schema and Content Enhancements:**
    *   The regulation schema was improved to support `colors` for map layers and `textualDefinition` for human-readable descriptions of geographic boundaries.
    *   The content was refined with improved summaries and consistent IDs for better cross-referencing.

#### 3. Backend and API Development: Powering the Interactions

While the PRD listed the feedback system as a "future feature," these changes build the entire backend required to support it.

*   **Database Schema**: The Prisma schema was extended with `ConsultationComment` and `ConsultationCommentUpvote` tables to store user feedback and interactions.
*   **API Endpoints**: New API routes were created to:
    *   Add, delete, and retrieve comments (`/api/consultations/[id]/comments`).
    *   Handle upvotes for comments (`/api/consultations/comments/[commentId]/upvote`).
*   **Email Integration**: A critical feature was implemented to automatically send an email to the municipality's designated contact address whenever a user submits a comment. The user is CC'd on the email for their records, ensuring a transparent and official feedback loop.

#### 4. Administrator Tools: Map-Based Geolocation Editor

A major achievement beyond the original PRD scope is the complete implementation of the **Map-Based Geolocation Editor**, transforming the conceptual design into a production-ready administrative tool.

*   **Complete Editing Workflow:**
    *   **Access Control**: Editing functionality is restricted to super administrators via `currentUser.isSuperAdmin` checks.
    *   **Visual Status System**: Comprehensive status indicators show geometry states - original data (‚úì), locally saved (üíæ), missing (‚ö†Ô∏è), and selected for editing (üéØ).
    *   **Editing Mode Toggle**: A dedicated "ŒõŒµŒπœÑŒøœÖœÅŒ≥ŒØŒ± ŒïœÄŒµŒæŒµœÅŒ≥Œ±œÉŒØŒ±œÇ" button in the layer controls activates the entire editing interface.

*   **Professional Drawing Interface:**
    *   **Mapbox GL Draw Integration**: Industry-standard drawing tools with custom styling (blue for inactive, orange for active elements).
    *   **Drawing Mode Selection**: Toggle between point and polygon creation with clear visual guidance.
    *   **Street Name Display**: Automatic addition of street labels during editing mode for better geographic orientation.

*   **User Experience Enhancements:**
    *   **Auto-Zoom**: Automatic map focus when selecting geometries for editing, using geometry bounds calculation.
    *   **Contextual Help**: Textual definitions display directly in the editing panel, providing guidance while drawing.
    *   **Real-time Preview**: Immediate visual feedback with locally saved geometries distinguished by blue styling.

*   **State Management System:**
    *   **localStorage Persistence**: Non-destructive editing with changes saved locally before export.
    *   **Event-driven Updates**: Custom event system ensures real-time synchronization across all UI components.
    *   **Performance Optimization**: Smart state comparison prevents unnecessary re-renders.

*   **Export and Production Workflow:**
    *   **Complete Export**: One-click export of entire regulation.json with all edits merged into the original structure.
    *   **Version Control**: Timestamped filenames for easy version tracking.
    *   **Edit Management**: Delete locally saved geometries with confirmation dialogs and immediate state updates.

*   **Technical Implementation Details:**
    *   **Component Architecture**: Seamless integration across ConsultationMap, LayerControlsPanel, GeoSetItem, and GeometryItem components.
    *   **Props Flow**: Comprehensive prop threading to enable editing functionality throughout the component hierarchy.
    *   **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for localStorage operations and geometry calculations.

This implementation elevates the platform from a consultation viewer to a comprehensive administrative tool, enabling municipalities to efficiently digitize and maintain their geographic regulation data.

#### 5. Navigation and User Experience

The PRD's emphasis on intuitive navigation, shareable links, and a clean UI is reflected in several key updates.

*   **Permanent Links (Permalinks)**: A `PermalinkButton` component has been created and integrated throughout the UI. This allows users to copy a direct link to any specific chapter, article, or geographic area, fulfilling a core requirement.
*   **Interactive Cross-References (`MarkdownContent.tsx`)**: The `{REF:id}` syntax described in the PRD is now fully functional. The system intelligently detects the type of reference and creates a link that navigates the user to the correct view (either scrolling in the document or focusing on the map).
*   **SEO & Social Sharing (`api/og/route.tsx`)**: A new API endpoint generates custom **Open Graph (OG) images** for consultations. This means that when a consultation link is shared on social media, it will display a rich, informative preview card, aligning with the goal of "shareable deep links."
*   **UI/UX Refinements**: Numerous small but important UI improvements were made, including:
    *   **Mobile-first Design**: Components like the navigation tabs and headers were made responsive to work well on smaller screens.
    *   **Better Feedback**: The comments overview sheet was fixed to prevent mis-clicks, and the detail panel now shows a warning for geographic locations that are missing map data.
    *   **Improved Layout**: The design of party and person pages was refined for better visual hierarchy and consistency.

In conclusion, these code changes transform the PRD from a set of requirements into a functional, feature-rich, and user-friendly platform. The implementation closely follows the specified architecture, delivering a robust foundation for public consultations. The comprehensive Map-Based Geolocation Editor represents a significant advancement, providing municipalities with professional-grade tools for managing geographic regulation data. This transforms the platform from a consultation viewer into a complete administrative solution, enabling end-to-end management of regulatory geographic content from initial digitization through public consultation to final deployment.
